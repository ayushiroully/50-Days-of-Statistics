# 50 Days of Statistics
Essential statistics concept for machine learning and data science.

### Overview
This blog aimed at the machine learning and data science enthusiasts, who want to understand the underlying world of statistics. The blog designed in indigestible chunks and key concepts from statistics that are relevant to the field.

**Two goals underlie this blog:**

* To explain which ideas are relevant and useful from a data science perspective, and why.

* Implement the concept in Python to understand better from the programmer perspective.
